# CSS Box Model Live Preview

This project is a simple interactive simulation designed to help users understand and visualize the **CSS Box Model**. It demonstrates how properties like `width`, `padding`, `border`, and `box-sizing` affect the size and layout of an element in real-time.

## Features

- **Interactive Inputs:** Adjust the width, height, padding, and border of the box.
- **Box Sizing Toggle:** Switch between `content-box` and `border-box` to see how the element's dimensions are calculated differently.
- **Live Display:** The content and full dimensions update dynamically based on user input.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts for better usability on smaller screens.

## Purpose

This project was created as an educational tool to teach and reinforce the concept of the CSS Box Model, which is fundamental to web development and layout design.

## How It Works

1. Enter values for the box's width, height, padding, and border in the input fields.
2. Toggle the box-sizing property to see the difference between `content-box` and `border-box`.
3. Observe the live updates in both the box and the dimension details displayed below it.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive functionality and real-time updates.
